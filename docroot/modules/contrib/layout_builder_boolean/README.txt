INTRODUCTION
------------
Layout Builder Boolean creates new "Boolean" versions of any Layout
plugin that is defined on your site in a layouts.yml file. Each
"Boolean" layout has a configurable field that acts as a switch
to determine whether the True regions or False regions will be
rendered.

It is most useful for configuring entity displays for entities
that have optional fields. This module is not likely useful for
configuring one-off layout overrides. That is, it's more useful
for site building than for content authoring.

CONFIGURATION
